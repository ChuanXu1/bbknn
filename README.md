# Batch balanced KNN

BBKNN is a fast and intuitive batch effect removal tool for direct use in the [scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) workflow. It serves as an alternative to `scanpy.api.pp.neighbors()`, with both functions creating a neighbour graph for subsequent use in clustering, pseudotime and UMAP visualisation. The standard approach begins by identifying the k nearest neighbours for each individual cell across the entire data structure, with the candidates being subsequently re-evaluated for connectivity before serving as the basis for further analyses. If technical artifacts (be they because of differing data acquisition technologies, protocol alterations or even particularly severe operator effects) are present in the data, they will make it challenging to link corresponding cell types.

As such, BBKNN actively combats this effect by splitting your data into batches and finding a smaller number of neighbours for each cell within each of the groups. This helps create connections between analogous cells in different batches without altering the counts or PCA space, and any cell types specific to individual samples retain their autonomy due to scanpy's follow-up processing on the altered k nearest neighbour candidate list.
